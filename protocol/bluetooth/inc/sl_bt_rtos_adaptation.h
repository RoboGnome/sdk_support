 *
 * @brief Bluetooth RTOS adaptation
 *
 * The Bluetooth RTOS adaptation component implements the relevant interfaces
 * for running the Bluetooth stack in an RTOS. When initialized in @ref
 * sl_bt_rtos_init(), the component creates the required RTOS tasks for the
 * Bluetooth stack itself, and an event task that is used to deliver
 * sl_bt_process_event() and sl_bt_on_event() callbacks to the application.
 *
 * To guarantee thread safety and avoid the risk of deadlocks, the Bluetooth
 * RTOS adaptation implementation makes the following promises with regard to
 * the locking mechanism provided in the API:
 *
 * 1. The stack will never directly call sl_bt_process_event() or
 *    sl_bt_on_event() from within the same callstack that is calling a command
 *    function. The callbacks always come from a processing loop in an event
 *    task created for this purpose.
 *
 * 2. The stack will never internally obtain the @ref sl_bt_bluetooth_pend()
 *    lock. It is safe for the application to obtain the lock also from within
 *    the sl_bt_on_event() callback.
